cmd commands

create local git repo : git init
find existed git repo : git status
how to delete git repo: rm -rf .gitgit ad

if we create git repo with above commands we get with as master but we dont want it so

create local git repo : git init -b main
to add file to staging: git add firstcode.txt
to find no of commits : git log
how to commit         : git commit -m "here you can mention what you have done and made changes "

evry time you do changes you have to do staging then commit, 
to do this you need follow above same procedure but if you want to skip staging and do direct commit 

you have execute this : git commit -a -m "skipping staging area"

if you want to find what is modified from last version when it is working directory
                      : git diff
incase if the file already moved to staging area then 
                      : git diff --staged
if you want to add all file to staging (we use .)
                      : git add .
if some file by mistake you add commit then want to remove from git
                      : git rm --cached passwords
once you remove this file you have to commit as well


after creating Github account, to have an permenenat connection, we can use SSH key.
how to create SSH key : ssh-kegen -o
key will be generated in defalult folder then :ls -a find hidden folders then you will find id_rsa.pub 
file and copy the content from it then open github in browser then settings then ssh key 
enter this key.

connection to Github  :git remote add origin git@github.com:DhanunjayL1995/My-projects.git
